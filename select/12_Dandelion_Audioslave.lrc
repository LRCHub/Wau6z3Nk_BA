[00:21.97] Settle down now and sit with me
[00:27.36] Let me tell you how this all came to be
[00:32.57] A yellow flower with your pedals to the air
[00:37.26] And flying on paper wings that brought you here
[00:43.72] Summer rolls on in the lazy hours
[00:48.91] An ether dream way
[00:51.05] Of hummingbirds and clouds
[00:54.94] Midnight swims in the cool back waves
[00:59.38] And you in my arms as it rolls away
[01:16.88] 
[01:04.75] Little dandelion
[01:08.09] Let your heart keep time
[01:12.92] Now the clouds are gone
[01:15.29] All of your tomorrows shine
[01:20.23] Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:25.98] All of your tomorrows shine
[01:31.15] Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:36.24] All of your tomorrows shine
[01:49.74] 
[01:42.37] Born of restless night the moon as a pearl
[01:47.67] Playing games down inside your soft warm world
[01:52.75] Hear my voice I know that you can
[01:57.37] You're the fire in my eyes
[02:00.66] The sun as a man
[02:04.35] Seasons come along and seasons go
[02:09.16] And what they'll leave behind
[02:11.42] I don't pretend to know
[02:15.19] I'm afraid that all I have missed
[02:19.83] Will loom very large when the darkness lifts
[02:41.83] 
[02:25.35] Little dandelion
[02:28.45] Let your heart keep time
[02:32.98] Now the clouds are gone
[02:35.53] All of your tomorrows shine
[02:40.53] Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:46.04] All of your tomorrows shine
[02:51.21] Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:56.58] All of your tomorrows
[03:07.08] 
[02:59.47] I will ride by your side wherever you go
[03:04.82] I won't run I won't hide just letting you know
[03:10.33] Just letting you know
[03:20.83] 
[03:40.52] Little dandelion
[03:43.61] Let your heart keep time
[03:48.79] Now the clouds are gone
[03:51.21] All of your tomorrows shine
[03:58.43] Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
[04:04.07] All of your tomorrows shine
[04:08.75] Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
[04:14.22] All of your tomorrows shine
[04:19.02] Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
[04:24.78] All of your tomorrows shine
