(My sweet and I)
Do you recall the time
You captured this heart of mine?
Lying in a field full of dandelions
You are my life, you're my sunshine
A beautiful flower, wild but yet divine
So hard to find
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion
While I was lying in the autumn breeze
I felt a brush against my skin
So elegantly free (so delicate was she)
So delicate was she (how beautiful)
And something deep within was calling out to me
Where have you been?
I've waited patiently (I've waited so long for you)
I never thought you'd find your way
Her voice so heavenly, dear God, I can't believe
An angel sent to me, don't ever go away
Do you recall the time
You captured this heart of mine?
Lying in a field full of dandelions
You are my life, you're my sunshine
A beautiful flower, wild but yet divine
So hard to find
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion
I plucked a petal just to taste and see
Ohh, how sweet your love could really be (so sweet)
Then all the honey bees would surely envy me
Don't let this fantasy become a memory (it keeps going)
I'll be the rain that falls upon you
Let me be your morning dew
I'll be the breeze embracing you (ohh, baby)
I'll be the sun that shines so brightly
On the darker side of you
Throughout the night I'll be your guiding light
The star that's watching you, baby
Do you recall the time (do you recall the time)
You captured this heart of mine?
Lying in a field full of dandelions
You are my life, you're my sunshine
A beautiful flower, wild but yet divine
So hard to find
(So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad)
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion
Do you recall the time
You captured this heart of mine?
Lying in a field full of dandelions
You are my life, you're my sunshine
A beautiful flower
Wild but yet divine (beautiful flower)
So hard to find
(You know, you're so hard to find)
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion (ohh, lovely)
Lovely is she
Heaven sent
Beauty far beyond what any eye can see
And now my life is so complete
And I believe you're the air I breathe
The song I sing, my everything
Do you recall the time
You captured this heart of mine?
Lying in a field full of dandelions (yeah, baby)
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion (ohh, I need you)
Do you recall the time (ohh, yeah)
You captured this heart of mine?
Lying in a field full of dandelions (ohh, you took my heart)
You are my life, you're my sunshine
Ohh, a beautiful flower, wild but yet divine
So hard to find (you're so soft and so beautiful)
I'm glad (I'm glad) I picked my lovely dandelion
Do you remember you took my heart, baby?
Do you remember took my soul away from me?
And I love you, baby, love you for it, baby
And I love
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion (you)
