[01:10.10] **Well I wrote a song for you
[01:13.72] And its all about how you died
[01:22.03] And I'll sing my song for you
[01:31.18] When the winter months go by**
[01:39.47] Well You miss the Sun
[01:46.75] And I'll Bet you miss the Sky
[01:55.89] And I'm also beginning to think,
[02:04.03] That you're missing everything
[02:19.03]
