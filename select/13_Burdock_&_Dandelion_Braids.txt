Oops, I'm feeling lost again
Guess I'll wander round the drug store
Till I forget that I feel conflicted
Till I feel calmed
'Cause everything around me is moving faster
Than we ever expected
I've got a weapon in my pocket
That I'm lifting to my face 90 times a day

I heard I could fix my pain with flower tinctures
Burdock and dandelion, flower tinctures
I heard I could fix my pain with a box hair dye
The red highlight kind

And my pain is I'm getting older
And I try not to mind
I really try not to mind

The boy I want is supported by his parents
Doesn't have the nerve to text me back after a fuck
But has the nerve to ask me if I like my breasts
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't

But I lied to him and told him that I loved them
And then I died a little inside
I felt the problem was with me
But the problem was with him
What if I asked, do you like your cock?

Oh, god, I want to feel so beautiful in my skin
And oh, gods, I want to find someone to celebrate my state with
And oh, god, will I ever find that one?
And oh, gods, I want to feel so beautiful in my skin
And oh, gods, I want to find someone to celebrate my state with
And oh, god, why the hell do we all want someone, need someone?

Do you? Do you? Do you?
Do you? Do you? Do you?
Do you? Do you? Do you?
