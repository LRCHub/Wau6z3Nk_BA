Your body must be
cold when I'm away
My bones need a warm
touch from your embrace
You're calling on me,
I can't answer
I'm far out of reach and
you're dancing alone
There I go again on the road
I'm missing you I wish
I were home with you
Alone with you, I do
If I could choose anywhere to be
I'd wanna be with you
I'm tired of being away
from your side, my dandelion
We could go anywhere tonight
As long as I'm with you
Doesn't even really matter
what we do
Wish that I was by your side,
my dandelion
We could go anywhere tonight,
dandelion
You take up every corner
of my brain
I'm blinking just so I can
see your face, and
Every picture that I've
ever taken
Is wasted if you're not part
of the view
There's nothing less I'm
willing to lose
I'm counting down the days
till it's you
And I sitting eye to eye, and
I just hope that you are too
If I could choose anywhere to be
I'd wanna be with you
I'm tired of being away
from your side, my dandelion
We could go anywhere tonight
As long as I'm with you
Doesn't even really matter
what we do
Wish that I was by your side,
my dandelion
We could go anywhere tonight,
dandelion
Oh, dandelion
(Dandelion)
Oh, we could go anywhere
We could go anywhere we need to,
baby
We could go anywhere we need to,
baby
We could go anywhere we need to,
baby
We could go anywhere
If I could choose anywhere to be
I'd wanna be with you
I'm tired of being away
from your side, my dandelion
We could go anywhere tonight
As long as I'm with you
Doesn't even really matter
what we do
Wish that I was by your side,
my dandelion
We could go anywhere tonight,
dandelion
