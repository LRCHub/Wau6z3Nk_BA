Dandelion seed
Carried on the breeze
Float into the sky
Where will you stray?
Which path which way?
Will you fall or fly?

Close your eyes and you're in the clouds
Drift away from yesterday's crowd

Dandelion seed
To this world you're freed
Boundless and untied
Where will you stray?
Which path which way?
Will you drop or glide?

Close your eyes and you're in the clouds
Drift away from yesterday's crowd

Dandelion seed
Carried on the breeze
Dandelion seed
To this world you're freed

Close your eyes and you're in the clouds
Drift away from yesterday's crowd
