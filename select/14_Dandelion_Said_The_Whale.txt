Dandelion
Alone with me
Comfort me
My everything
Stay with me
Be the sun
Dandelion
Oh dandelion

A breath of wind
The slightest breeze
You float away
Across the sea
Call to me
Come home to me
Dandelion
Oh dandelion

Could have seen the stars
I wished away
The brightest days
I wished away
The brightest days

Dandelion
A glass of wine
A mug of tea
We will be fine
Speak with me
When I'm old and grey
Call me up
My dandelions

Say good bye
Oh Dandelions
Oh suns of mine
Oh sweet perfume
Watch me burn
I am the sun
Remember me
My dandelions

Could have seen the
Could have seen the
Could have seen the stars
I wished away
The brightest days
I wished away
The brightest days
I wished away
The brightest days
